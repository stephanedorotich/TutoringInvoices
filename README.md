# TutoringInvoices

This program helps me keep track of my tutoring business by allowing me to input and saving all of my sessions. It saves all my students and keeps track of which sessions they've had and whether or not those sessions have been paid for.
Additionally, it allows me to generate a unique pdf invoices for students based on their unpaid sessions.

Much of its usability is still under construction. 

Running "python ui.py" generates invoice0.pdf in invoices for \$160 for Paul Dorotich.
